      <h2>Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Checkseed</strong> is a tool that allows users to create custom
        mnemonic phrases that can be used as a seed in Electrum, a widely used
        Bitcoin wallet. Unlike BIP-39, where the seed is derived from a
        predefined dictionary of words, Electrum uses the hash of the mnemonic
        phrase to generate the master key. This characteristic enables Electrum
        to accept any mnemonic phrase, making it possible to create personalized
        mnemonics while still generating valid wallets.
      </p>
      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        Electrum determines the wallet version by examining the first bits of
        the hash generated from the mnemonic phrase. If the beginning of the
        hash does not match a recognized wallet version, Electrum will reject
        the mnemonic. Checkseed solves this issue by automatically appending a
        nonce to the user-provided mnemonic. This nonce is adjusted until the
        hash of the entire mnemonic (including the nonce) starts with the
        correct bits for a supported wallet version, such as
        <code>SegWit</code> or <code>Standard</code>.
      </p>
      <h3>Example Workflow</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>User Input:</strong> Begin with a custom phrase, such as "i
          liek bitcoin ".
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automatic Nonce Search:</strong> Checkseed automatically
          appends and adjusts a nonce to the input phrase, hashing the result
          repeatedly until the hash begins with the required bits for the
          desired wallet version.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Result:</strong> The process produces a mnemonic like "i liek
          bitcoin 178", where "178" is the nonce that makes the hash valid for
          the selected wallet version.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Important Considerations</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Security Risks:</strong> Custom mnemonics often have lower
        entropy compared to randomly generated ones, making them more
        susceptible to collisions or brute-force attacks. This increases the
        risk of funds being compromised. It's important to thoroughly understand
        these risks before using Checkseed-generated mnemonics in a live wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Electrum Compatibility:</strong> After generating the mnemonic,
        it should be tested to confirm that it correctly generates the intended
        wallet in Electrum and that the correct wallet version is recognized.
      </p>
      <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>
        Using low-entropy, human-generated mnemonics as wallet seeds introduces
        significant security risks, including the potential loss of funds. For
        securing substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, it is strongly
        recommended to use standard, randomly generated mnemonics. Custom
        mnemonics should only be used with a full understanding of the
        associated risks.
